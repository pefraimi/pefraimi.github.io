	abstract = {The cost of interacting with a blockchain and the time required to search and retrieve information from it are important factors in the design of Decentralized Applications (DApps). The corresponding approaches for data management in Ethereum vary from pure on-chain solutions to hybrid architectures. In this work, we thoroughly examine a wide range of data management methods, including unconventional ones, and evaluate them in terms of storage cost and retrieval latency while considering the impact of recent hard forks. More precisely, we elaborate on the use of Smart Contract (SC) storage as a data store for DApps and in view of the prohibitive cost inherent to this approach, we present and compare methods for low-cost data handling in Ethereum, namely the event-logs, the transaction payload, and the almost surprising exploitation of unused function arguments. In addition, we study hybrid schemes by using IPFS and Swarm as storage platforms and Ethereum as a timestamping proof mechanism. Such schemes are especially effective when large chunks of data have to be managed. The upload and retrieval performance of these platforms and the cost associated with storing (on-chain) the identifiers of the uploaded data are of utmost importance and therefore are investigated in detail.},

	abstract = {Cellular traffic prediction is of great importance on the path of enabling 5G mobile networks to perform intelligent and efficient infrastructure planning and management. However, available data are limited to base station logging information. Hence, training methods for generating high-quality predictions that can generalize to new observations across diverse parties are in demand. Traditional approaches require collecting measurements from multiple base stations, transmitting them to a central entity and conducting machine learning operations using the acquire data. The dissemination of local observations raises concerns regarding confidentiality and performance, which impede the applicability of machine learning techniques. Although various distributed learning methods have been proposed to address this issue, their application to traffic prediction remains highly unexplored. In this work, we investigate the efficacy of federated learning applied to raw base station LTE data for time-series forecasting. We evaluate one-step predictions using five different neural network architectures trained with a federated setting on non-identically distributed data. Our results show that the learning architectures adapted to the federated setting yield equivalent prediction error to the centralized setting. In addition, preprocessing techniques on base stations enhance forecasting accuracy, while advanced federated aggregators do not surpass simpler approaches. Simulations considering the environmental impact suggest that federated learning holds the potential for reducing carbon emissions and energy consumption. Finally, we consider a large-scale scenario with synthetic data and demonstrate that federated learning reduces the computational and communication costs compared to centralized settings.}

	abstract={Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for privacy-enhancement and latency minimization in various real-world applications, such as transportation, communications, and healthcare. FL endeavors to bring Machine Learning (ML) down to the edge by harnessing data from million of devices and IoT sensors, thus enabling rapid responses to dynamic environments and yielding highly personalized results. However, the increased amount of sensors across diverse applications poses challenges in terms of communication and resource allocation, hindering the participation of all devices in the federated process and prompting the need for effective FL client selection. To address this issue, we propose Cellular Automaton-based Client Selection (CA-CS), a novel client selection algorithm, which leverages Cellular Automata (CA) as models to effectively capture spatio-temporal changes in a fast-evolving environment. CA-CS considers the computational resources and communication capacity of each participating client, while also accounting for inter-client interactions between neighbors during the client selection process, enabling intelligent client selection for online FL processes on data streams that closely resemble real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation of the proposed CA-CS algorithm using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, while making a direct comparison against a uniformly random client selection scheme. Our results demonstrate that CA-CS achieves comparable accuracy to the random selection approach, while effectively avoiding high-latency clients.}

	abstract={Cellular traffic prediction is a crucial activity for optimizing networks in fifth-generation (5G) networks and beyond, as accurate forecasting is essential for intelligent network design, resource allocation and anomaly mitigation. Although machine learning (ML) is a promising approach to effectively predict network traffic, the centralization of massive data in a single data center raises issues regarding confidentiality, privacy and data transfer demands. To address these challenges, federated learning (FL) emerges as an appealing ML training framework which offers high accurate predictions through parallel distributed computations. However, the environmental impact of these methods is often overlooked, which calls into question their sustainability. In this paper, we address the trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption in FL by proposing a novel sustainability indicator that allows assessing the feasibility of ML models. Then, we comprehensively evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) architectures in a federated scenario using real-world measurements from base station (BS) sites in the area of Barcelona, Spain. Our findings indicate that larger ML models achieve marginally improved performance but have a significant environmental impact in terms of carbon footprint, which make them impractical for real-world applications.}

      abstract={The provision of social care applications is crucial for elderly people to improve their quality of life and enables operators to provide early interventions. Accurate predictions of user dropouts in healthy ageing applications are essential since they are directly related to individual health statuses. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have enabled highly accurate predictions, outperforming traditional statistical methods that struggle to cope with individual patterns. However, ML requires a substantial amount of data for training, which is challenging due to the presence of personal identifiable information (PII) and the fragmentation posed by regulations. In this paper, we present a federated machine learning (FML) approach that minimizes privacy concerns and enables distributed training, without transferring individual data. We employ collaborative training by considering individuals and organizations under FML, which models both cross-device and cross-silo learning scenarios. Our approach is evaluated on a real-world dataset with non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data among clients, class imbalance and label ambiguity. Our results show that data selection and class imbalance handling techniques significantly improve the predictive accuracy of models trained under FML, demonstrating comparable or superior predictive performance than traditional ML models.}

We used pre-processing techniques to construct classification models that predict the adherence of users using dynamic and static features. We submitted 11 official runs and our results show that machine learning algorithms can provide high-quality adherence predictions. Based on the results, the dynamic features positively influence a model's classification performance. Due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset, we employed oversampling methods such as SMOTE and ADASYN to improve the classification performance.

	abstract = {With the growing number of Location-Based Social Networks, privacy-preserving point-of-interest (POI) recommendation has become a critical challenge when helping users discover potentially interesting new places. Traditional systems take a centralized approach that requires the transmission and collection of private user data. In this work, we present FedPOIRec, a privacy-preserving federated learning approach enhanced with features from user social circles to generate top-N POI recommendations. First, the FedPOIRec framework is built on the principle that local data never leave the owner’s device, while a parameter server blindly aggregates the local updates. Second, the local recommender results are personalized by allowing users to exchange their learned parameters, enabling knowledge transfer among friends. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving protocol for integrating the preferences of the user’s friends, after the federated computation, by exploiting the properties of the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) fully homomorphic encryption scheme. To evaluate FedPOIRec, we apply our approach to five real-world datasets using two recommendation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedPOIRec achieves comparable recommendation quality to centralized approaches, while the social integration protocol incurs low computation and communication overhead on the user device.},

The system, named FedNCF, enables learning without requiring users to disclose or transmit their raw data. Data localization preserves data privacy and complies with regulations such as the GDPR. Although federated learning enables model training without local data dissemination, the transmission of raw clients’ updates raises additional privacy issues. To address this challenge, we incorporate a privacy-preserving aggregation method that satisfies the security requirements against an honest but curious entity. We argue theoretically and experimentally that existing aggregation algorithms are inconsistent with latent factor model updates. We propose an enhancement by decomposing the aggregation step into matrix factorization and neural network-based averaging. Experimental validation shows that FedNCF achieves comparable recommendation quality to the original NCF system, while our proposed aggregation leads to faster convergence compared to existing methods. We investigate the effectiveness of the federated recommender system and evaluate the privacy-preserving mechanism in terms of computational cost.}

	abstract={Blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger technology initially developed to secure cryptocurrency transactions. Following its revolutionary use in cryptocurrencies, blockchain solutions are now being proposed to address various problems in different domains, and it is currently one of the most “disruptive” technologies. This paper presents a scoping review of the scientific literature for exploring the current research area of blockchain applications in the agricultural sector. The aim is to identify the service areas of agriculture where blockchain is used, the blockchain technology used, the data stored in it, its combination with external databases, the reason it is used, and the variety of agricultural products, as well as the level of maturity of the respective approaches. The study follows the PRISMA-ScR methodology. The purpose of conducting these scoping reviews is to identify the evidence in this field and clarify the key concepts. The literature search was conducted in April 2021 using Scopus and Google Scholar, and a systematic selection process identified 104 research articles for detailed study. Our findings show that in the field, although still in the early stages, with the majority of the studies in the design phase, several experiments have been conducted, so a significant percentage of the work is in the implementation or piloting phase. Finally, our research shows that the use of blockchain in this domain mainly concerns the integrity of agricultural production records, the monitoring of production steps, and the monitoring of products. However, other varied and remarkable blockchain applications include incentive mechanisms, a circular economy, data privacy, product certification, and reputation systems. This study is the first scoping review in this area, following a formal systematic literature review methodology and answering research questions that have not yet been addressed.}

In this work, we investigate the information contained in unique structural data of social networks, namely the lists or collections of items, and assess their potential in recommendation systems.

This is based on the fact that POI lists are user generated content and can be considered as collections of related POIs. Our method attempts to extract these relations and express the notion of similarity using graph theoretic, set theoretic and statistical measures. Our approach is applied on a Foursquare dataset of two popular destinations in northern Greece and is evaluated both via an offline experiment and against the opinions of local populace that we obtain via a user study.

In this paper we discuss a new ambiguity in the definition of the BA model by identifying the tight relation between the preferential attachment process and unequal probability random sampling. While the probability that each individual vertex is selected is set to be proportional to their degree, the model does not specify the joint probabilities that any tuple of m vertices is selected together for m>1. We demonstrate the consequences using analytical, experimental, and empirical analyses and propose a concise definition of the model that addresses this ambiguity. Using the connection with unequal probability random sampling, we also highlight a confusion about the process via which nodes are selected on each time step, for which - despite being implicitly indicated in the original paper - current literature appears fragmented.}

abstract = {Android devices contain a vast amount of personal data of their owners. These data are stored on the device and are protected by the Android permission scheme. Android apps can obtain access to specific data items by requesting the appropriate permissions from the user. However, in Android, the access to certain assets is granted by default to the installed apps. For example, any Android app has the right to get the device's network operator, which may be used to infer information about user's country and nationality. Similarly, any app has access to the clipboard which may occasionally contain very sensitive information, like a password. Consequently, a honest but curious Android app may leverage the implicit access rights to accumulate such unguarded information pieces and gradually build a detailed profile of the user.

  abstract={In this work, we show that Twitter users can reveal valuable political information about particular Nodes of Interest (NOIs) they opt to follow. More precisely, we utilize an interesting graph projection method and a series of algorithmic approaches, such as modularity clustering, a minimum linear arrangement (MinLA) approximation algorithm and the DeGroot opinion update model in order to reveal the political affinity of selected NOIs. Our methods, which are purely structure-based, are applied to a snapshot of the Twitter network based on the user accounts of NOIs, consisting of the members of the current Greek Parliament along with their respective followers. The findings confirm that the information obtained can portray with significant precision the political affinity of the NOIs. We, furthermore, argue that these methods are of general interest for imprinting the political leaning of other NOIs, for example news media, and potentially classifying them in respect to their political bias.}

In the former case, the DeGroot model takes the form of a Markov Decision Process (MDP), while in the latter case it takes the form of a Stochastic Game (SG). These models are solved using probabilistic model checking techniques, as well as other solution techniques beyond model checking. The viability of our analysis is attested on a well-known social network, the Zachary’s karate club. Finally, the evaluation of influence in a social network simultaneously with the decision maker’s cost is supported, which is encoded as a multi-objective model checking problem.}

In the first approach, the politicians followed by the followers of the user are shown to be correlated to the politicians that the user follows. In the second one, the media that the user follows are used to predict the politicians that the user follows.

abstract = {Summary In this work we examine how quality of service (QoS) can be achieved in a real network by allowing packets to coordinate using fiat money in a market economy for router queue positions. In this context we implement and evaluate the PacketEconomy mechanism in the discrete-event simulator OMNET++, using the standard INET library for simulating Internet Protocol version 6 networks and evaluate throughput, end-to-end delay, and packet drop rates. Additionally, we examine whether the flows have a game-theoretic incentive to participate in the market economy, while covering both Transmission Control Protocol– and User Datagram Protocol–based flows in multiple different cases. The mechanism achieves QoS by allowing packets with different QoS requirements waiting to be served in router queues to mutually trade positions by exchanging money. Notably, each flow can independently and selfishly define the ask and bid prices of its packets. In this manner, packets can coordinate to be able to self-regulate their packet-specific access to shared network resources. The results are promising and show that the innovative PacketEconomy mechanism provides robust, effective, and fine-grained QoS while maintaining end-user control for both rate- and window-based flows.},

abstract={We focus on personal data generated by the sensors and through the everyday usage of smart devices and take advantage of these data to build a non-invasive contextual suggestion system for tourism. The system, which we call Pythia, exploits the computational capabilities of modern smart devices to offer high quality personalized POI (point of interest) recommendations. To protect user privacy, we apply a privacy by design approach within all of the steps of creating Pythia. The outcome is a system that comprises important architectural and operational innovations. The system is designed to process sensitive personal data, such as location traces, browsing history and web searches (query logs), to automatically infer user preferences and build corresponding POI-based user profiles. These profiles are then used by a contextual suggestion engine to anticipate user choices and make POI recommendations for tourists. Privacy leaks are minimized by implementing an important part of the system functionality at the user side, either as a mobile app or as a client-side web application, and by taking additional precautions, like data generalization, wherever necessary. As a proof of concept, we present a prototype that implements the aforementioned mechanisms on the Android platform accompanied with certain web applications. Even though the current prototype focuses only on location data, the results from the evaluation of the contextual suggestion algorithms and the user experience feedback from volunteers who used the prototype are very positive.}

	abstract = {Purpose  – This work aims to argue that it is possible to address discrimination issues that naturally arise in contemporary audio CAPTCHA challenges and potentially enhance the effectiveness of audio CAPTCHA systems by adapting the challenges to the user characteristics.  Design/methodology/approach  – A prototype has been designed, called PrivCAPTCHA, to offer privacy-preserving, user-centric CAPTCHA challenges. Anonymous credential proofs are integrated into the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) protocol and the approach is evaluated in a real-world Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) environment.  Findings  – The results of this work indicate that it is possible to create VoIP CAPTCHA services offering privacy-preserving, user-centric challenges while maintaining sufficient efficiency.  Research limitations/implications  – The proposed approach was evaluated through an experimental implementation to demonstrate its feasibility. Additional features, such as appropriate user interfaces and efficiency optimisations, would be useful for a commercial product. Security measures to protect the system from attacks against the SIP protocol would be useful to counteract the effects of the introduced overhead. Future research could investigate the use of this approach on non-audio CAPTCHA services.  Practical implications  – PrivCAPTCHA is expected to achieve fairer, non-discriminating CAPTCHA services while protecting the user’s privacy. Adoption success relies upon the general need for employment of privacy-preserving practices in electronic interactions.  Social implications  – This approach is expected to enhance the quality of life of users, who will now receive CAPTCHA challenges closer to their characteristics. This applies especially to users with disabilities. Additionally, as a privacy-preserving service, this approach is expected to increase trust during the use of services that use it.  Originality/value  – To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first comprehensive proposal for privacy-preserving CAPTCHA challenge adaptation. The proposed system aims at providing an improved CAPTCHA service that is more appropriate for and trusted by human users.},

  abstract={Starting from the premise that modern routers are not protected from aggressive and unresponsive flows, we define a new, almost stateless, active queue management scheme, called Prince. The basic idea is to protect the fair share of well-behaved flows. We adopt a game theoretic view, where incentive is given to the majority flow by dropping its packets at congestion. In order to find the majority flow, we focus on the queue of the router and detect the flow with the most packets in it. From a game-theoretic point of view, Prince manages to track and bound aggressive flows and favor socially responsible ones. Our results show that in this context Prince resembles MaxMin Fairness allocation. Finally, we also examine a streaming version of the algorithm that can be fine-tuned to any desired performance/accuracy trade-off point.}

Findings  – The results of this work indicate that, even though providing access to personal data of smartphone users is by definition neither problematic nor unlawful, today’s smartphone operating systems do not provide an adequate level of protection for the user’s personal data.

AMS adopts state-of-the-art metadata vocabularies, annotation techniques and semantic web technologies. Interoperability is achieved by reusing several vocabularies and ontologies, including Dublin Core, PROV-O, FOAF, Geonames, Creative commons, SKOS, and CiTO, each of which provides with orthogonal views for annotating different aspects of digital assets. Our system invests a great deal in managing geospatial and temporal metadata, as they are extremely relevant for tourism-related applications. AMS has been implemented as a graph database using Neo4j, and is demonstrated with a dataset of more than 160000 images downloaded from Flickr. The system provides with online recommendations, via queries that exploit social networks, spatiotemporal references, and user rankings.

In brief, given a ‘sensitive’ search query, the objective of our work is to retrieve the target documents from a search engine without disclosing the actual query. Our approach, which builds upon and improves recent work on search privacy, approximates the target search results by replacing the private user query with a set of blurred or scrambled queries. The results of the scrambled queries are then used to cover the private user interest. We model the problem theoretically, define a set of privacy objectives with respect to web search and investigate the effectiveness of the proposed solution with a set of queries with privacy issues on a large web collection. Experiments show great improvements in retrieval effectiveness over a previously reported baseline in the literature. Furthermore, the methods are more versatile, predictably-behaved, applicable to a wider range of information needs, and the privacy they provide is more comprehensible to the end-user. Additionally, we investigate the perceived privacy via a user study, as well as, measure the system’s usefulness taking into account the trade off between retrieval effectiveness and privacy. The practical feasibility of the methods is demonstrated in a field experiment, scrambling queries against a popular web search engine.

  abstract={We present Pythia, a privacy-enhanced non-invasive contextual suggestion system for tourists, with important architectural innovations. The system offers high quality personalized recommendations, non-invasive operation and protection of user privacy. A key feature of Pythia is the exploitation of the vast amounts of personal data generated by smartphones to automatically build user profiles, and make contextual suggestions to tourists. More precisely, the system utilizes (sensitive) personal data, such as location traces, browsing history and web searches (query logs), to build a POI-based user profile. This profile is then used by a contextual suggestion engine for making POI recommendations to the user based on her current location. Strong privacy guarantees are achieved by placing both mechanisms at the user-side. As a proof of concept, we present a Pythia prototype which implements the aforementioned mechanisms as mobile applications for Android, as well as, web applications.}

Each individual user is represented by a personal software agent, deployed in the cloud, where it collaborates on distributed computations without loss of privacy, including with respect to the cloud service providers. We present a generic system architecture involving a cryptographic protocol based on a homomorphic encryption scheme for aggregating sensing data into maps, and demonstrate security in the Honest-But-Curious model both for the users and the cloud service providers. We validate our system in the context of NoiseTube, a participatory sensing framework for noise pollution, presenting experiments with real and artificially generated data sets, and a demo on a heterogeneous set of commercial cloud providers. To the best of our knowledge our system is the first operational privacy-preserving system for participatory sensing. While our validation pertains to the noise domain, the approach used is applicable in any crowd-sourcing application relying on location-based contributions of citizens where maps are produced by aggregating data  also beyond the domain of environmental monitoring.}

Each activity is characterized by attributes describing its location, cost, availability and duration range. The system makes activity recommendations based on user-selected criteria, such as visit duration and timing, geographical areas of interest and visit profiling. The user edits the proposed list and the system creates a plan, taking into account temporal and geographical constraints imposed by the selected activities, as well as by other events in the user's calendar. The user may edit the proposed plan or request alternative plans. A recommendation engine employs non-intrusive machine learning techniques to dynamically infer and update the user's profile, concerning his preferences for both activities and resulting plans, while taking privacy concerns into account. The system is coupled with a module to semi-automatically feed its database with new activities in the area.},

Two are the main goals of our approach. First, to enhance the privacy of patients. Second, to decongest the Health Monitoring Center (HMC) from the enormous amount of biomedical data generated by the users' wearable sensors. In our solution personal software agents are used to receive and manage the personal medical data of their owners. Moreover, the personal agents can support privacy-preserving distributed statistical analysis of the health data To this end, we present a cryptographic protocol based on secure multi-party computations that accept as input current or archived values of users' wearable sensors. We describe a prototype implementation that performs a statistical analysis on a community of independent personal agents. Finally, experiments with up to several hundred agents confirm the viability and the effectiveness of our approach.}

In this paper, we present a game-theoretic model, in which the game is played between SPIT senders and internet telephony users. The game includes call filters and audio CAPTCHA, so as to classify incoming calls as legitimate or malicious. We show how the resulting model can be used to decide upon the trade-offs present in this problem and help us predict the SPIT sender’s behavior. We also highlight the advantages in terms of SPIT call reduction of merely introducing CAPTCHA, and provide experimental verification of our results.},

  abstract={In this report we give an overview of our participation in the TREC 2013 Contextual Suggestion Track. We present an approach for context processing that comprises a newly designed and fine-tuned POI (Point Of Interest) data collection technique, a crowdsourcing approach to speed up data collection and two radically different approaches for suggestion processing (a k-NN based and a Rocchio-like). In the context processing, we collect POIs from three popular place search engines, Google Places, Foursquare and Yelp. The collected POIs are enriched by adding snippets from the Google and Bing search engines using crowdsourcing techniques. In the suggestion processing, we propose two methods. The first submits each candidate place as a query to an index of a user’s rated examples and scores it based on the top-k results. The second method is based on Rocchio’s algorithm and uses the rated examples per user profile to generate a personal query which is then submitted to an index of all candidate places. The track evaluation shows that both approaches are working well; especially the Rocchio-like approach is the most promising since it scores almost firmly above the median system and achieves the best system result in almost half of the judged contextprofile pairs. In the final TREC system rankings, we are the 2nd best group in MRR and TBG, and 3rd best group in P@5, out of 15 groups in the category we participated.}

More precisely, we examine two natural interpretations of the item weights, describe an existing algorithm for each case ([2, 4]), discuss sampling with and without replacement and show adaptations of the algorithms for several WRS problems and evolving data streams.},

  abstract ={Knuth [12, Page 417] states that "the (program of the) Fibonaccian search technique looks very mysterious at first glance" and that "it seems to work by magic". In this work, we show that there is even more magic in Fibonaccian (or else Fibonacci) search. We present a generalized Fibonacci procedure that follows perfectly the implicit optimal decision tree for search problems where the cost of each comparison depends on its outcome.},

	abstract = {Purpose In order to enhance privacy protection during electronic transactions, the purpose of this paper is to propose, develop, and evaluate a personal data management framework called Polis that abides by the following principle: every individual has absolute control over his/her personal data that reside only at his/her own side. Design/methodology/approach This paper identifies representative electronic transactions that involve personal data and proposes Polis‐based protocols for them. The approach is evaluated on a Polis prototype both as a stand‐alone application and as part of a commercial database management system. Findings The results of this paper indicate that electronic transactions can remain both feasible and straightforward, while personal data remain only at the owner's side. Research limitations/implications This paper describes a Polis‐approach implementing prototype, which is easy to deploy and friendly to current information management technologies. However, the usability of the prototype has to be enhanced with supporting tools for editing personal data and policies and a more intuitive user interface. Finally, the Polis‐platform enables a new class of user‐centered distributed applications, which it intends to investigate. Practical implications Even though the conditions for a personal data management approach like Polis are mature, and Polis can be progressively adopted, it still entails a major change in current business practices. Originality/value This paper proposes a new paradigm for the management of personal data, which admits individuals to have their personal data stored only at their own side. The new approach can be of mutual benefit to both individuals and companies.},
