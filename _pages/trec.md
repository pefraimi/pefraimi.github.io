__Problem Description__

The goal of the [*TREC Challenge 2013*](https://sites.google.com/site/treccontext/trec-2013-guidelines){:target="_blank"} was to investigate search techniques considering as context only the userâ€™s location, as well as, user interests via personal preferences and past history. More precisely, given a set of user profiles and a set of contexts, the objective is to suggest new context on users, tailored to reflect their preferences.

__Participation__

Our team ranked in the __second place__ regarding MRR and TBG and __third place__ regarding the P@5 measure in the TREC Challenge 2013 using personalized recommendations based on Rocchio-like and k-NN user-item queries. The corresponding [publication](https://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec22/papers/DUTH-context.pdf){:target="_blank"} has been presented in the [Twenty-Second Text REtrieval Conference 2013](https://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec22/trec2013.html){:target="_blank"}, held in November 19-22, 2013.
