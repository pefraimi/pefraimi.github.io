  - title: SUSANNA
    date: July-November 2023
    tags: Blockchain, IoT
    description: "SUSANNA project aims to redefine water meter management. The primary objective of this project is the establishment of a robust and secure blockchain network specifically designed for IoT water meter authentication, prevention of data tampering, and the utilization of Ricardian contracts to automate legal processes. With a permissioned blockchain architecture based on Hyperledger Fabric, SUSANNA transforms conventional data collection methods by leveraging advanced IoT infrastructure. Through the implementation of Smart Contracts, we ensure secure data sharing, storage, and analysis, thus thwarting malicious actions and fostering reliable water utilization measurement and leak detection. Hierarchical access ensures data confidentiality for organizations like water management entities, governmental bodies, and data stakeholders. Utilize existing platforms to design Ricardian contracts with which the blockchain will communicate to make decisions based on the customer's agreement with the provider. In short, automated processes should be triggered depending on the data collected from the IoT devices and the agreements defined in the aforementioned contracts. Consequently, a crucial aspect of the project entails the progressive enhancement of a system that will allow setting up customized Hyperledger Fabric networks quickly. In addition to that, it will contribute to the management of the network, enabling one to upgrade the policies, organizations, Chaincodes, etc. In conclusion, SUSANNA aspires to revolutionize water meter utilization management through blockchain technology. By enhancing data security, privacy, and reliability, our project sets the stage for a future with robust smart cities and innovative water management practices."

    description: "The rapid spread of the internet in the modern world creates new channels for the exchange of information and news amongst its users. Established news organizations and numerous individuals have at their disposal modern media that allow them to spread news and opinions to a wide audience while each internet user can be informed directly from any source in the world about what is happening. The formation of public opinion has taken on a new dimension as the volume of news and the speed of its dissemination change the rules of the game that have been established for decades. <br> However, the channels of news and opinions dissemination are not devoid of drawbacks and risks. The lack of authentication mechanisms for users who publish their views allows fake news to spread. In addition, the need for news sources to increase the traffic in their websites, and consequently their revenues, often leads to the publication of articles with provocative titles of questionable validity in order to impress readers and, thus, calling into question their objectivity. Many claim that uninhibited dissemination of news contributes to the formation of more thorough and valid public opinion, but the frequent phenomena of fake and misleading news necessitate further investigation of this claim. <br> The aim of this research was to clearly formulate the concepts of bias and validity as well as to evaluate them on an online news dissemination graph. Our research data came from a popular online social network (OSN). Modern algorithms from the field of graph theory were used for the analysis of the data and the opinions’ propagation patterns, while widespread models of opinion dynamics were utilized for node classification and the study and calculation of the concepts of bias and validity. <br> The innovation of our research was based on the use of modern algorithms and concepts for the study of opinion diffusion and, in particular, the quality of news. In our research we adapted recent concepts to a case study of a popular OSN focusing on the Greek news media scene and, with the use of algorithms from different scientific fields, we evaluated its complex features. Our research was based on publicly available data and we studied graph-theoretically complex concepts such as objectivity in the modern news landscape."

  - title: Atlas
    date: 2012-2015
    tags: Recommendation Systems, Social Graphs
    description: "The objective of the ATLAS project was to develop a holistic approach for tourism information retrieval and recommendation exploiting multiple rich media related resources on the web. The scientific and technical objectives of the project were: <br> O1 - To collect data and define usage context. Analysis of the representative application scenarios and the definition of the corresponding conditions for evaluating ATLAS services. Furthermore, building content and metadata collections to provide a basis for algorithm development and application prototyping. <br> O2 - To develop robust geo-aware multimedia retrieval techniques. a) Developing efficient tagging techniques through user- rich media - metadata modeling, b) Recommendation and retrieval based on multilinear subspace and sparse techniques and efficient sublinear indexing techniques. <br> O3 - To put ATLAS technology to work. Creation of ATLAS software tools, build on social graphs linking rich media, users, and metadata and integrate the search intent and user satisfaction models into advanced retrieval mechanisms. The ATLAS technology was demonstrated through trials and demos related to the application scenarios. <br> <strong>Industrial Partners </strong> for this project were LINK Technologies and 3Pi Information Systems. <br> <strong> Academic Partners </strong> were Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and Athena Research and Innovation Center."
  
  - title: SPICE
    date: 2010-2013
    tags: Networks, Space, Security
    description: "The laboratory of Internetworked Systems of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Democritus University of Thrace, Greece, has made significant contributions to the architectural requirements, objectives standardization and prototyping of future Space Internetworking strategy in Europe and beyond. Space Internetworking has gained momentum in both Space and Internet Communities and enters a phase of wide experimentation, standardization and deployment, binding scientific expertise of diverse communities. We intend to strengthen our research potential and broaden our scientific expertise in major areas covered by Space Internetworking. This includes protocol technology for Space and Earth, mission requirements and design strategies, distributed applications for Space data, mechanisms and algorithms for space data processing, including security issues. <br> The scheduled activities of this project will result in the unification of three laboratories in a European Center for Space Internetworking (SPICE), capable of consulting significant missions, undertaking important projects such as the unification of space and earth communication and also hosting world-class experts. Therefore, funding of the project will leave a permanent quality stamp in the region through a world-class center of innovation, which will promote science, European competitiveness and certainly will greatly boost the social and economical status of the convergence region of Thrace. <br> Our scope is to lead the research community towards the most promising directions of research and development in the area of DTN in order to disseminate, create awareness and stimulate exploitation of this knowledge by European Commission, ESA, National Research funding organizations and international standardization bodies, such as IETF and CCSDS. This will be achieved through the mobility of SPICE researchers to cooperating research institutes, the employment of researchers, the organization of panel sessions and workshops, the upgrade of the existing research infrastructure, the organization of regular presentations from high-level scientists etc. <br> In this context, the effects of SPICE project span greater than the three-year duration of the project. The development and operation of a research institution on Space Internetworking, that accommodates research staff, promotes innovative, high-level research and attracts worldwide interest, will greatly boost the social and economical status of a convergence region like Thrace."
